**Description:** This workshop will introduce you to [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) and
[Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), two data wrangling libraries at the
frontier of high-performance computation. (See
[benchmarks](https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/).) In addition to being
extremely fast and portable, both DuckDB and Polars provide user-friendly
implementations across multiple languages. This makes them very well suited to
production and applied research settings, without the overhead of tools like
Spark. We will provide a variety of real-life examples in both R and Python,
with the aim of getting participants up and running as quickly as possible. We
will learn how wrangle datasets extending over several hundred million
observations in a matter of seconds or less, using only our laptops. And we will
learn how to scale to even larger contexts where the data exceeds our computersâ€™
RAM capacity. Finally, we will also discuss some complementary tools and how
these can be integrated for an efficient end-to-end workflow (data I/O ->
wrangling -> analysis).
